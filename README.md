I am a Senior Hardware Security Engineer at <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/" style="color:#0645AD;">Azure Hardware Security Architecture (AHSA)</a> at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/" style="color:#0645AD;">Microsoft</a>, Redmond, where I design root of trust (RoT) to meet the enhanced security requirements of modern edge and confidential computing workloads. My interests include hardware implementation of applied cryptography, post-quantum cryptography, designing highly optimized computation architecture in industrial IoT and embedded devices, and side-channel protection. 

I received my Ph.D. degree in <a href="https://www.fau.edu/engineering/" style="color:#0645AD;">Computer Engineering</a> from <a href="https://www.fau.edu/" style="color:#0645AD;">Florida Atlantic University</a> in 2022. I received my B.Sc. and M.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering from Amirkabir University of Technology and Iran University of Science and Technology in 2011 and 2015.

Since 2011 I worked as a hardware engineer and spent the first 8 years of my career on FPGA-based distributed computing system. In 2019, I started working on post-quantum cryptography and efficient implementation of cryptographic algorithm as a member of the <a href="https://www.fau.edu/isense/" style="color:#0645AD;">The Institute for Sensing and Embedded Network Systems Engineering (ISENSE)</a> supervised by <a href="https://faculty.eng.fau.edu/azarderakhsh/" style="color:#0645AD;">Prof. Reza Azarderakhsh</a>. My Ph.D. thesis is titled "Efficient and Secure Implementation of Classic and Post-Quantum Public-Key Cryptography".
